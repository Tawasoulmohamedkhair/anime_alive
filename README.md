Anime Alive App

Anime Alive is a Flutter app for anime fans to explore series and characters. It uses mock data for rapid prototyping and follows Clean Architecture for better maintainability.

Home Screen: Browse anime series and top characters. (Category filtering is a planned feature.)

Detail Screen: View anime stats, genres, and descriptions.

Upgrade Plan: Select subscription plans with interactive cards.

The app separates UI, business logic, and data, making it scalable and easy to extend. Moreover, smooth animations enhance the user experience, and on the other hand, the architecture prepares it for future API integration.
